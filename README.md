# Pundit

## Introduction
This is a project for Udacity's React Developer NanoDegree. It's a Reddit clone that allows users to:

  - Post content
  - Filter posts by category and sort them by different metrics
  - Comment on posts
  - Vote on posts and comments

Since I have an affinity for cheesy humor, its focus is on puns, dad jokes, and wordplay. :-)

  - NodeJS, React, Redux, React Router
  - Bootstrap layout and design using [ReactStrap](https://reactstrap.github.io)
