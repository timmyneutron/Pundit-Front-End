# Pundit

## Introduction
This is a project for Udacity's React Developer NanoDegree. It's a Reddit clone that allows users to:

  - Post content
  - Filter posts by category and sort them by different metrics
  - Comment on posts
  - Vote on posts and comments

Since I have an affinity for cheesy humor, its focus is on puns, dad jokes, and wordplay. :-)

The [back end for this project](https://github.com/timmyneutron/Pundit-Back-End) is based off of [starter code supplied by the instructors at Udacity](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter). It maintains the original endpoints from the starter code, with modifications to integrate a MongoDB database.
